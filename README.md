Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a class of artificial neural networks and
a subnet of Machine Learning, has become dominant in various computer vision tasks. It
is designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features through
backpropagation by using multiple building blocks, such as convolution layers, pooling
layers, and fully connected layers. Handwritten digits classification has been treated as a
multi-class classification problem in the machine learning context, where each of the ten
digits (0â€“9) is viewed as a class and the machine learning task is essentially to train a
model that can effectively discriminate the ten classes. A representative dataset provides
much greater accuracy without any bias instead of any other random dataset. Therefore,
here we use MNIST dataset, after training on which for several iterations, the results can
be predicted without human intervention.
